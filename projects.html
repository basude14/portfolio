                    <ul>
                        <li>Built a system to conduct voting virtually in a secure manner. Every vote is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain are irreversible hence, the votes.</li>
                        <li>Build front end of the project using HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT. The programming language used is Solidity.</li>
                        <li>Ethereum platform is used as it offers flexible platform to build apps using Solidity scripting language and Ethereum virtual machine.</li>
                        <li>Developed an interface for users to cast their votes.</li>

                   <ul>
                    <li>Online Library Management System is a system which maintains the information about the books present in the library, their authors, the members of library to whom books are issued, etc.</li>
                    <li>The whole divided as front end, back end, and database. The front end is designed using HTML, CSS, PHP and JAVASCRIPT.</li>
                    <li>XAMPP is used as a localhost which consists of MySQL database for storing the data of the books.</li>
                    <li>It consists of different modules such as User module and Admin module. User module has various sub-modules like New User Register, Student Login, Search Book, Issue Book, and Return Book.</li>
                    <li>Admin module is operated by an admin with unique username and password.</li>

                        <li>Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), an ailment deriving from diabetics is a severe condition that affects the eye. Although there are procedures for detecting DR, they need manual evaluation of ophthalmologist.</li>
                        <li>So, we developed a model which uses Deep Learning for the purpose of this ailment through automation.</li>
                        <li>This model is built with Keras and Tensorflow backend with python and suggested name is “Wide Net X.”</li>
                        <li>Achieved a 92% accuracy which is higher than current system models.</li>
